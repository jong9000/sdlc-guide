# User Acceptance Testing

"User acceptance testing (UAT) consists of a process of verifying that a solution works for the user." <sup>[[1]]</sup>

### Basics
- UAT is not system testing
- often called "Beta testing"
- should be performed by a subject-matter-expert (SME)
- one of the final stages of a project
- done in a "Staging Environment"

"It is important that the materials given to the tester be similar to the materials that the end user will have. Testers should be given real-life scenarios such as the three most common or difficult tasks that the users they represent will undertake." <sup>[[1]]</sup>
